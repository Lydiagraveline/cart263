    <h2>FRAGMENTS OF SAPPHO</h2>
      <p>
        Deathless Aphrodite <span class="redacted"> of the spangled mind,
        </span> <br>
        child of Zeus, who twists lures, I beg you <br>
        do not break with hard pains, <br>
        <span class="indent">  O <span class="redacted"> lady, my heart </span> </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        but come here if ever before <br>
        you caught my <span class="redacted"> voice <span> far off <br>
        and listening left your father's <br>
        <span class="indent"> golden house and came, </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        yoking your car. And fine birds brought you, <br>
        quick sparrows over the black earth <br>
        whipping their wings down the sky <br>
        <span class="indent"> through midairâ€” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        they arrived. But you, O blessed one, <br>
        <span class="redacted"> smiled in your deathless face </span> <br>
        and asked what (now again) I have suffered and why <br>
        <span class="indent"> (now again) I am calling out </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        and what I want to happen most of all <br>
        in my <span class="redacted"> crazy heart. </span> Whom should I persuade (now again) <br>
        to lead you back into her love? Who, O <br>
        <span class="indent"> Sapho, is wronging you? </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        For if she flees, soon she will pursue. <br>
        If she refuses <span class="redacted"> gifts,</span> rather will she give them. <br>
        If she does not love, soon she will love <br>
        <span class="indent"> even unwilling. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="redacted">Come to me </span> now: loose me from hard <br>
        care and all my heart longs <br>
        to accomplish, accomplish. You <br>
        <span class="indent"> be my ally. </span>
      </p>
