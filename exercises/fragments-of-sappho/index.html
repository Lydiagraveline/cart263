         <h2>FRAGMENTS OF SAPPHO</h2>
         <p class="desc">This webpage is an interactive way to read Anne Carson's translation of Sappho
         from her book <i>If Not, Winter. </i> Sappho lived on the island of Lesbos from bout 630 B.C. She was a musical
           genius who devoted her life to composing and performing songs. Of the nine
           books of lyrics Sappho is said to have composed, only one poem has survived
           complete. All the rest are fragments. Experience the drama of trying to read a paprus torn in half or riddled
           with holes. Keep up with the actively disintegrating text by hovering your mouse
           over the fading fragments.</p>

          Deathless Aphrodite <span class="lost redacted"> of the spangled mind,</span><br>

          <span class="indent"><span class="lost redacted"> golden house </span> and came, </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          yoking your car. And fine birds brought you, <br>
          quick sparrows over the black earth <br>
          whipping their wings down the sky <br>
          <span class="indent"> through midair— </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          they arrived. But you, O blessed one, <br>
          <span class="lost redacted"> smiled in your deathless face </span> <br>
          and asked what (now again) I have suffered and why <br>

        <p>

          <span class="indent"> Sappho, is wronging you? </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          For if she flees, soon she will pursue. <br>
          If she refuses <span class="lost redacted"> gifts,</span> rather will she give them. <br>
          If she does not love, soon she will love <br>
