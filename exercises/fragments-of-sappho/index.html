        <h2>FRAGMENTS OF SAPPHO</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          This webpage is an interactive way to read Anne Carson's translation
          of Sappho from her book <i>If Not, Winter. </i> Sappho lived on the
          island of Lesbos from bout 630 B.C. She was a musical genius who
          devoted her life to composing and performing songs. Of the nine books
          of lyrics Sappho is said to have composed, only one poem has survived
          complete. All the rest are fragments. Experience the drama of trying
          to read a paprus torn in half or riddled with holes. Keep up with the
          actively disintegrating text by hovering your mouse over the fading
          fragments.

            <span class=" redacted"> smiled in your deathless face </span>

            and asked what (now again) I have suffered and why <br />
